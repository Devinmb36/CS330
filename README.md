How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with a clear head and a lot of patience, I need to be able to focus on my work and troubleshoot for errors, so finding an environment that can help me focus is important, that is why I am always at the coffee shop. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has helped me craft 3D shapes and a 3D scene, with colors and textures and the ability to morph shapes to my liking. 3D design is very important in the computer science world and is the reason our technology has advanced so far, think the first iphone; it needed to be designed in a 3D environment, conceptualized before physically created. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
The good ol' engineering design process, where you define your guidelines, start working on the project, troubleshoot, test, and run. This is all I did the entire project. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
These tactics are used by millions of engineers, it is the foundation of our process, and sticking by this design process will determine my success in my career. 
How do I approach developing programs?
Approach developing programs cautiously and with prior knowledge, research the product you are working towards, put yourself in the users shoes, and have prior knowledge of the software being used to design the program. Build experience through troubleshooting and working your way through errors. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
A new development strategy I used is organization, to be honest I was never very organized with my work and programs before this course, it hidnered instructors from grading my work and made it harder for myself to follow along with my code. Adding critical commentary, spacing my code, highlighting important areas is what made my project work so well. 
How did iteration factor into your development?
Observing the instructors code and using it to create my own code, doing this repetively and using the same functions/variables over and over again is the iteration present in my program. Such as Drawshapemesh, this was used multiple times in each project. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The course layout helped a lot in developing my final project since many assignments taught you how to do milestones in the final project, such as setup lighting and shading, textures, creating shapes, sizing the shapes and moving the shapes, coloring the shapes, etc. By the time the final project came around it was a breeze compared to the start of the course, and I had the final project 60% done. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goals are ultimately to further advance our society and positively impact as many people as I can, since I will never be a billionare in my life to where I can just give everyone my wealth (easiest way to help people), I need to center my career towards helping people in my community and locally, which is a small contribution but something I can reliably do, and I plan to design equipment for surgeons to use during long critical surgeries. Equipment like this already exists, but it can be better. I plan to innovate it. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This will prepare me for my next courses since I developed organizational skills, which will help my instructors understand and read my code better. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Organizational skills are a given expectation for any employer in any career, these skills will improve my chances of being hired but also being kept and seen as a valuable, organized employee.
